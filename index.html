                <p>"I had known and worked closely with Tajuddin before and after independence. He was not only a
                    patriot but also in my view the most serious minded, conscientious and competent as well as the most
                    hardworking among the Ministers. Tajuddin usually took the views of the Planning Commission
                    seriously and, if convinced, strongly supported them during Cabinet discussions. The entire Planning
                    Commission had great respect for him."</p>
